	ClearChildViewState	Deletes the view-state information for all the server control's child controls.
	ClearEffectiveClientIDMode	Infrastructure. Sets the ClientIDMode property of the current control instance and of any child controls to Inherit.
	CreateChildControls	Called by the ASP.NET page framework to notify server controls that use composition-based implementation to create any child controls they contain in preparation for posting back or rendering.
	CreateControlCollection	Creates a new ControlCollection object to hold the child controls (both literal and server) of the server control.
	DataBind	Binds a data source to the invoked server control and all its child controls.
	DataBind(Boolean)	Binds a data source to the invoked server control and all its child controls with an option to raise the DataBinding event.
	DataBindChildren	Binds a data source to the server control's child controls.
	Dispose	Enables a server control to perform final clean up before it is released from memory.

	FindControl(String)	Searches the current naming container for a server control with the specified id parameter.
	FindControl(String, Int32)	Infrastructure. Searches the current naming container for a server control with the specified id and an integer, specified in the pathOffset parameter, which aids in the search. You should not override this version of the FindControl method.
	Focus	Sets input focus to a control.
